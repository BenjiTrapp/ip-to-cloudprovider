This file contains valid IPv4 addresses both in standalone form and embedded within larger strings. There's also some invalid data and random text. The goal is to test whether the SortAndUnique function correctly extracts and handles valid IPv4 addresses from various scenarios.

Once you've created this file in the testdata directory relative to your test file, you can run your tests again.
